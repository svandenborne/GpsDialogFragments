This project is an example on how to use an AlertDialog in a DialogFragment using android.support.v4.app.DialogFragment
(for backward compatibility on pre-Honeycomb devices), which shows your current location (latitude, longitude).

This app was tested on smartphone Acer Liquid Galant Black with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich
and on HTC Sensation Android 4.0.3

=> still to be tested for Android versions < 4.0!

The AlertDialog that is implented shows the location settings, that can be used to switch on the GPS setting.


This example was based on two examples I found:

1.http://code.google.com/p/dialogfragmentdemo/

2.http://www.androidhive.info/2012/07/android-gps-location-manager-tutorial/
=> this uses android.app.AlertDialog

Here you can find the original GPSTracker.java file which I slightly changed:
I removed the procedure showSettingsAlert and kind of reimplemented it in the GpsDialogFragment.java file
